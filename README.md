# TechDebtTracker
Frontend:
  - React with TypeScript',
  - Tailwind CSS for styling',
  - React Beautiful DnD for drag-and-drop functionality',
  - Vite as the build tool',
  - Various Radix UI components for UI elements',
  - React Query for data fetching',
        
Backend:
  - Express.js server',
  - Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL database',
  - TypeScript',
  - Zod for schema validation',

This application is a Technical Debt Management System with a Kanban board interface, allowing users to create, update, and track tech debt items across different statuses (backlog, in progress, done).
        
The architecture follows a modern TypeScript stack with shared types between frontend and backend (in the shared/schema.ts file) and uses a component-based architecture with reusable UI components.
